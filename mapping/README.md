Python Folium Map Marker Project
Welcome to our Python project where we utilize Folium, a Python library for creating interactive maps, to mark spots on the map. This project demonstrates how to leverage Folium's capabilities to visualize geographic data and create interactive maps with customizable markers.

Project Overview:
The main objective of this project is to mark specific locations or points of interest on a map using Folium.

Features:
Marking Spots: We provide functionality to mark spots on the map by specifying their latitude and longitude coordinates.
Customizable Markers: Users can customize the markers with different icons, colors, and popup messages to enhance the map's visual appeal and informational value.
Interactive Map: The resulting map is interactive, allowing users to zoom in, zoom out, and pan across the map to explore marked spots.
